Review of the Experience

After working with the provider's code, we've gained valuable insights about our own implementation.
One key lesson was about interface design - seeing how the provider structured their interfaces with
clear separation between Card, Cell, and View components made us realize our implementation could
have benefited from similar clarity. Their use of enums for PlayerColor was particularly clever
compared to our string-based approach. Additionally, their battle mechanics implementation was more
robust and clearly structured than ours. The adapter pattern implementation taught us the importance
of planning for clearer and cohesive code from the start. If we had designed our interfaces with more
consideration for potential integration with other implementations, the adaptation process would
have been smoother.

Our experience with the providers was generally positive and professional. The code they provided was
well-documented and followed consistent patterns, making it relatively straightforward to understand.
When questions arose about specific implementations or missing components, like the Hole class,
they were responsive and helpful in clarifying their design decisions. The main challenge was working
around the missing implementations while maintaining the integrity of their design. However, this
challenge turned into a valuable learning experience about interface design and adaptation.
Their view implementation was planned very well, and working with it helped us to understand
better approaches to UI design in Java.
